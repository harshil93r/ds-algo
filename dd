They use:
		- XG-Firewall
		- Intercept-x
		- Heartbeat Solution (feature of XG-Firewall)

- They're very unhappy with Sophos support
- check constantly for Ransomware Attacks, Alerts
- Mostly use default settings: rarely changes settings.
- Use prtg integration with Sophos (Heartbeat Solution) (shared screen to show us)
- Happy with integration, prtg is also integrated with Acronis Backup.


They used to use McAfee before sophos.
They want to have some monitoring for acronis, maybe in Nagios.
